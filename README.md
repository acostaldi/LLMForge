# LLMForge

**LLMForge** is a fullstack platform for developers to deploy, configure, and interact with large language models (LLMs) ‚Äî using their **own cloud compute** through federated infrastructure.

Designed to resemble internal ML tools used by growing AI teams, LLMForge allows users to authenticate, provision model instances, manage settings like temperature/top-k, and get secure API access ‚Äî all without needing to host or fund centralized compute.

> üåê Supports **federated compute**: run your LLMs using services like Google Colab, GCP, or AWS ‚Äî connected securely through your own credentials.

> ‚öôÔ∏è Automatically configures and provisions optimized compute instances based on your selected model, balancing performance, resource constraints, and cost efficiency.

## Project Goal

LLMForge was built to be a hobbyist and developer oriented LLM management tool ‚Äî combining fullstack engineering, modern DevOps, and AI integration.

Its goals include:

- **Federated Deployment**: Let users bring their own infrastructure (BYOC) by connecting Colab, GCP, or AWS through OAuth-based flows
- **Secure Access**: Generate and manage scoped API keys per model instance
- **Frontend Control Panel**: Configure model parameters and launch prompt sessions via web UI
- **DevOps-Ready**: Built with CI/CD, Vercel, Clerk, Terraform, and containerized backends (FastAPI in progress)

## What Is Federated Infrastructure?

Rather than hosting inference centrally (which is costly and limited), LLMForge allows users to link **their own compute resources**:

- Authenticate with your Google account (Colab/GCP)
- Provision infrastructure dynamically (e.g. a Colab notebook, GCP function)
- Deploy models via automated templates or your own scripts
- üéõControl settings via LLMForge and use generated API keys locally or in your apps

This makes LLMForge especially useful for:

- AI devs with free or budget compute credits
- Hobbyists using Colab for experimentation
- Small teams needing secure but flexible model orchestration
